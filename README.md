## Pre-midsem week
- I worked on the theme park a little more, and wanted to make a roller coaster ride based on a line following bot idea
- I had to move back to India, and left a lot of my things in the college itself, so I started working just on the line following bot
- I had to scavenge a lot of parts to make the bot to work (could not buy them because of the lockdown)
- More about [Pre-midsem week](/Pre_midsem_Week/)

## Midsem Week
- Combined all the parts together and made the bot to work
- Tried two different codes to make the bot work
- The [Youtube Link](https://youtu.be/a-yLbLEQiu8) of my bot

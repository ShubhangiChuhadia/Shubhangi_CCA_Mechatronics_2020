- The IR sensor emitter pair I had were faulty so I had to try and test another IR led to see if it worked
- I was able to find IR Led in old remote controls that I broke to use it

- The resistor value I was using was very less, and I needed a 10k ohm resistor for it to work properly
- I broke a few charger adapters to find these resistors, arranged them in series to get a good value

- I only haad one transistor, but I needed two to control the motors
- I was able to find transistors on the circuit board of the remote control I broke earlier
- I also tried using scavenged wires to try and connect a transistor that did not have proper legs

- The bot was working now, but there was a lot of friction so I needed one more tire at the front
- I took the tire out of an old fruit trolley (with the help of my father) and oiled it to make it work without friction
